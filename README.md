## Demo using React, React-Window, React-Window-Infinite-Loader, React-Virtualized-Auto-Sizer, MaterialUI Grid, Redux, and Redux Observable (RxJs) for efficiently rendering large lists

### Inspiration

I wanted to figure out a way to render a virtualized grid with infinite loading.

Not only does this grid need to be virtualized for performance reasons, it must also be responsive and support rows of varying heights (just-in-time measured content)!
